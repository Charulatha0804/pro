#Smart Lecture AI

##Project Description
Smart Lecture AI is a Python-based project designed to help students understand lecture content more effectively.
It takes lecture audio as input, converts it into text-based notes, and allows users to ask questions based on the lecture.
The system then provides AI-generated explanations and stores the final content in Notion for future reference.

This project focuses on automation, clarity, and organized learning.

##How It Works
Lecture Audio → Text Notes → User Question → AI Explanation → Saved in Notion

##Features
- Converts lecture audio into text notes
- Allows users to ask questions based on lecture content
- Provides AI-generated explanations
- Organizes and saves outputs in Notion
- Modular and easy-to-understand Python code structure

#Technologies Used
- Python 3.10
- Visual Studio Code
- Git & GitHub

##Project Structure
The project is organized into separate Python files for audio processing,
transcription, AI response generation, and content storage.

##Running the Project
Install dependencies using `requirements.txt` and run `app.py`.

##Future Enhancements
- Support for multiple audio formats
- Improved AI response accuracy
- Web-based user interface
- Better note summarization features
